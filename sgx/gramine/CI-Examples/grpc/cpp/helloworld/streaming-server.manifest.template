# gRPC server manifest file example
#
# This manifest was prepared and tested on Ubuntu 18.04.

################################## GRAPHENE ###################################

# LibOS layer library of Graphene. There is currently only one implementation,
# so it is always set to libsysdb.so. Note that GRAMINE macro is expanded
# to relative path to Graphene repository in the Makefile as part of the
# build process.
loader.preload = "file:{{ graphene.libos }}"
libos.entrypoint = "file:streaming-server"

# Verbosity of Graphene debug log (none/error/warning/debug/trace/all). Note
# that GRAPHENE_LOG_LEVEL macro is expanded in the Makefile as part of the
# building process: the default is "error" for non-debug builds, and "debug"
# for debug builds.
loader.log_level = "{{ log_level }}"

################################# ARGUMENTS ###################################

# Read application arguments directly from the command line. Don't use this on production!
loader.insecure__use_cmdline_argv = 1

################################# ENV VARS ####################################

# Specify paths to search for libraries. The usual LD_LIBRARY_PATH syntax
# applies. Paths must be in-Graphene visible paths, not host-OS paths (i.e.,
# paths must be taken from fs.mount.xxx.path, not fs.mount.xxx.uri).
#
# In case of gRPC:
# - /lib is searched for Glibc libraries (ld, libc, libpthread)
# - {{ arch_libdir }} is searched for Name Service Switch (NSS) libraries
loader.env.LD_LIBRARY_PATH = "/lib:{{ arch_libdir }}:/usr/{{ arch_libdir }}"

################################## SIGNALS ####################################

# Allow for injecting SIGTERM signal from the host.
sys.enable_sigterm_injection = 1

################################## REMOTE ATTESTATION ####################################

# Request remote attestation functionality from Graphene
sgx.remote_attestation = 1

################################# MOUNT FS  ###################################

# General notes:
# - There is only one supported type of mount points: 'chroot'.
# - Directory names are (somewhat confusingly) prepended by 'file:'.
# - Names of mount entries (lib, lib2, lib3) are irrelevant but must be unique.
# - In-Graphene visible path names may be arbitrary but we reuse host-OS URIs
#   for simplicity (except for the first 'lib' case).

# Mount host-OS directory to Graphene glibc/runtime libraries (in 'uri') into
# in-Graphene visible directory /lib (in 'path'). Note that GRAMINE macro
# is expanded to relative path to Graphene repository in the Makefile as part
# of the build process.
fs.mount.lib.type = "chroot"
fs.mount.lib.path = "/lib"
fs.mount.lib.uri = "file:{{ graphene.runtimedir() }}"

# Mount host-OS directory to Name Service Switch (NSS) libraries (in 'uri')
# into in-Graphene visible directory /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu (in 'path').
fs.mount.lib2.type = "chroot"
fs.mount.lib2.path = "{{ arch_libdir }}"
fs.mount.lib2.uri = "file:{{ arch_libdir }}"

fs.mount.lib3.type = "chroot"
fs.mount.lib3.path = "/usr/{{ arch_libdir }}"
fs.mount.lib3.uri = "file:/usr/{{ arch_libdir }}"

# Mount host-OS directory to NSS files required by Glibc + NSS libs (in 'uri')
# into in-Graphene visible directory /etc (in 'path').
fs.mount.etc.type = "chroot"
fs.mount.etc.path = "/etc"
fs.mount.etc.uri = "file:/etc"

############################### SGX: GENERAL ##################################

# Set enclave size (somewhat arbitrarily) to 1024MB. Recall that SGX v1 requires
# to specify enclave size at enclave creation time. If Redis exhausts these
# 1024MB then it will start failing with random errors. Greater enclave sizes
# result in longer startup times, smaller enclave sizes are not enough for
# typical Redis workloads.
sgx.enclave_size = "1024M"

sgx.nonpie_binary = 1

# Set maximum number of in-enclave threads (somewhat arbitrarily) to 8. Recall
# that SGX v1 requires to specify the maximum number of simulteneous threads at
# enclave creation time.
#
# Note that internally Graphene may spawn two additional threads, one for IPC
# and one for asynchronous events/alarms. Redis is technically single-threaded
# but spawns couple additional threads to do background bookkeeping. Therefore,
# specifying '8' allows to run a maximum of 6 Redis threads which is enough.
sgx.thread_num = 8

############################# SGX: TRUSTED FILES ###############################

# Specify all files used by Redis and its dependencies (including all
# libraries which can be loaded at runtime via dlopen). The paths to files
# are host-OS paths. These files will be searched for in in-Graphene visible
# paths according to mount points above.
#
# As part of the build process, Graphene-SGX script (`graphene-sgx-sign`) finds each
# specified file, measures its hash, and outputs the hash in auto-generated
# entry 'sgx.trusted_checksum.xxx' in auto-generated redis-server.manifest.sgx.
# Note that this happens on the developer machine or a build server.
#
# At runtime, during loading of each "trusted file", Graphene-SGX measures its hash
# and compares with the one specified in 'sgx.trusted_checksum.xxx'. If hashes
# match, this file is trusted and allowed to be loaded and used. Note that
# this happens on the client machine.

sgx.trusted_files.grpc-async-server = "file:streaming-server"
#sgx.trusted_files.libra_tls_attest = "file:ra-tls-mbedtls"

sgx.trusted_files.runtime = "file:{{ graphene.runtimedir() }}/"
sgx.trusted_files.arch_libdir = "file:{{ arch_libdir }}/"
sgx.trusted_files.usr_arch_libdir = "file:/usr/{{ arch_libdir }}/"

# Trusted no-library files include configuration files, read-only files, and
# other static files. It is useful to specify such files here to make sure
# they are not maliciously modified (modifications will be detected as hash
# mismatch by Graphene-SGX).
#
# Redis by default does not use configuration files, so this section is empty.
# sgx.trusted_files.config = "file:<important-configuration-file>"

############################# SGX: ALLOWED FILES ###############################

# Specify all non-static files used by app. These files may be accessed by
# Graphene-SGX but their integrity is not verified (Graphene-SGX does not
# measure their hashes). This may pose a security risk!

# Name Service Switch (NSS) files. Glibc reads these files as part of name-
# service information gathering. For more info, see 'man nsswitch.conf'.
